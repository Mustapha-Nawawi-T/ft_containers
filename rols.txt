1 -> if tree empty . create new node as root nod with color BLACK ;

2 -> if tree not empty . create new nod as leaf node with color RED ;

3 -> if parent of new node is BLACK exit ;

4 -> if parent of new node is RED then check the color parent sibling :
	
	a ) if color is BLACK or __NIL_ then : do rotations && recoloring .

	b ) if color is RED then : recoloring && check for parents of parent of new node .


ROLS :

	=> root == BLACK .

	=> no adjacent RED nodes .

	=> every path should have same number of BLACK nodes .
